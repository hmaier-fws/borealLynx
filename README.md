This is a shiny app for visualizing and summarizing GPS collar data from lynx in Alaska. 
Currently, users upload a .csv file that at a minimum contains unprojected GPS fixes 
(lat/long), collarIDs and dates. See "Data.csv" as an example. These are read in and mapped using leaflet.
A summary table is produced that includes includes refuges and fist and last fix
dates, by collarID. Users can subset the data by date range, collarID, and Refuge.
